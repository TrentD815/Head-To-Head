# Head To Head
## Overview
  Head To Head is a simple interface where you can easily compare the stats of active NBA players. 
  
## Features
  - Search stats for all active NBA players
  - View side by side stat lines between 2 players 
  - Lookahead player search when looking up players (upcoming)
  - See how players stats are interconnected with other players on their team (upcoming)
  - Light and dark themes
  - Sleek design

## Personal Goals For This Project
  - Complete a project using Angular and Typescript as I feel exposure to these modern 
    frameworks/languages are crucial to progressing my skill set as a developer
  - Fulfill the vision that my friend and I desired to create a stat site where there are more 
    interconnected stats between
    NBA players that are not seen on other sites. This is done by not only utilizing the basic 
    statlines but by analyzing play by play records
  - Create a project that has a light/dark mode
  - Create a project that uses the "frosted glass" effect on certain visual elements 
    (commonly seen on iOS UI's)

## Environment
This project is actively available for viewing and interacting with via a Heroku server. Click 
on the "head-to-head-stats" link under the "Environments" section on the right side of this repo. 
Then click the "View Deployment" button to open the project in a new tab. Occasionally if there 
has been little traffic, first opening the project may take a bit (10-20 seconds) in order to 
wake the server. After waking the server, the project should run as normal.
