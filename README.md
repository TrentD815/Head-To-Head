# Head To Head
## Overview
  Head To Head is a simple interface where you can easily compare the stats of active NBA players. 
  
## Features
  - Search stats for all active NBA players
  - View side by side stat lines between 2 players
  - View stats based on season type (Regular/Playoffs) and by year (Single Year or Career)
  - Lookahead player search when finding players
  - Light and dark themes
  - Sleek design

## Personal Goals For This Project
  - Complete a project with a modern frontend framework. Angular and Typescript were chosen for this project
  - Create a project that has a light/dark mode
  - Create a project that uses the "frosted glass" effect on certain visual elements. This is
    commonly seen on iOS UI's

## Environment
View and play around with Head To Head [here](https://head-to-head-stats.herokuapp.com). Alternatively,
click on the "Environments" section on the right side of this repo. Then click "View Deployment" to 
open the project in a new tab. Occasionally if there has been little traffic, first opening the project 
may take a bit (10-20 seconds) in order to wake the server. After waking the server, the project should run as normal.
