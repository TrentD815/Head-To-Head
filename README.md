# Head To Head
## Overview
  Head To Head is a simple interface where you can easily compare the stats of active NBA players. 
  
## Features
  - Search stats for all active NBA players
  - View side by side stat lines between 2 players
  - View stats based on season type (Regular/Playoffs) and by year (Specific/Career)
  - Lookahead player search when finding players
  - See how players stats are interconnected with other players on their team (upcoming)
  - Light and dark themes
  - Sleek design

## Personal Goals For This Project
  - Complete a project using Angular and Typescript as I feel exposure to these modern 
    frameworks/languages are crucial to progressing my skill set as a developer
  - Fulfill the vision that my friend and I desired to create a stat site where there are more 
    interconnected stats between
    NBA players that are not seen on other sites. This is done by not only utilizing the basic 
    stat lines but by analyzing play by play records
  - Create a project that has a light/dark mode
  - Create a project that uses the "frosted glass" effect on certain visual elements 
    (commonly seen on iOS UI's)

## Environment
View and play around with Head To Head [here](https://head-to-head-stats.herokuapp.com). Alternatively,
click on the "Environments" section on the right side of this repo. Then click "View Deployment" to 
open the project in a new tab. Occasionally if there has been little traffic, first opening the project 
may take a bit (10-20 seconds) in order to wake the server. After waking the server, the project should run as normal.
